Configure options:
  Tensor tests:
  ./configure --with-gravity=with-tidal-tensors --with-stars=MOSAICS

  Isolated disc tests:
  ./configure --with-subgrid=COLIBRE-MOSAICS --with-hydro=anarchy-du --with-kernel=quintic-spline --disable-hand-vec --with-gravity=with-multi-softening-tensors


Need to make sure all SFing (or just all gas?) particles get tensors so they can be passed at star formation time
  Maybe a "calculate_gas_tensors" property in Gravity

At the end of mosaics_clevo we'll want to update gcflag depending if clusters survive or not

I/O: 
  Load star props (need TidalTensor so far)
  Also need to zero optional properties if they're not read in

Scheduling:
  Still necessary to call mosaics from runner_do_star_formation() since occasionally SF happens but mosaics would not be called. Already scheduled after the star resort so not sure what the fix is?


NOTES:
------

Setting of the calc_tensor flag for gpart is done at start of timestep in stars_init_spart. Just want to make sure this happens before the gravity calc.

I/O: 
  Hijacked "Stars" for our parameters

  Added Gravity:calculate_all_tensors to params. Do we also want to output all tensors to snapshots when this is set?

Have implemented a local 'GMC SFE'. But I think the subgrid density might be the wrong choice for tff
