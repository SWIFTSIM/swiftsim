Configure options:
  Tensor tests:
  ./configure --with-stars=MOSAICS --with-gravity=with-tidaltensor
  or
  ./configure --with-stars=MOSAICS --with-gravity=with-multi-softening-tensors

  Isolated disc tests:
  ./configure --with-subgrid=COLIBRE-MOSAICS --with-hydro=anarchy-du --with-kernel=quintic-spline --disable-hand-vec --with-ext-potential=hernquist --with-gravity=with-multi-softening-tensors --with-mosaics-max-clusters=100

TODO:
-----

MOSAICS stars requires tensor gravity

Stellar neighbour search needs testing again

At the end of mosaics_clevo we'll want to update gcflag depending if clusters survive or not

I/O: 
  Load star props (need TidalTensor so far)
  Also need to zero optional properties if they're not read in

  Dump some info when nClust > MOSAICS_MAX_CLUSTERS

Scheduling:
  MPI for veldisp tasks (cell.c, engine_maketasks.c)

runner_doiact_functions_stars_veldisp.h has checks for STARS_MOSAICS (since requires new_star flag), in other cases we probably don't want to schedule the veldisp section

NOTES:
------

I/O: 
  Hijacked "Stars" for our parameters

Have implemented a local 'GMC SFE'. Not sure it works as expected though

Have set 1 * scount for stars_veldisp scheduling (i.e. Nnew * scount)
