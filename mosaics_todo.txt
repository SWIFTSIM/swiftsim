Configure options:
  Tensor tests:
  ./configure --with-gravity=with-tidal-tensors --with-stars=MOSAICS

  Isolated disc tests:
  ./configure --with-subgrid=COLIBRE-MOSAICS --with-hydro=anarchy-du --with-kernel=quintic-spline --disable-hand-vec --with-ext-potential=hernquist --with-gravity=with-multi-softening-tensors --with-mosaics-max-clusters=100

TODO:

Stellar neighbour search needs testing

At the end of mosaics_clevo we'll want to update gcflag depending if clusters survive or not

I/O: 
  Load star props (need TidalTensor so far)
  Also need to zero optional properties if they're not read in

  Dump some info when nClust > MOSAICS_MAX_CLUSTERS

Scheduling:
  MPI for veldisp tasks (cell.c, engine_maketasks.c)

Double check new parts in runner_doiact_functions_hydro.h

Test the stellar neighbour search


NOTES:
------

I/O: 
  Hijacked "Stars" for our parameters

Have implemented a local 'GMC SFE'. Not sure it works as expected though

Have set 1 * scount for stars_veldisp scheduling (i.e. Nnew * scount)
