./configure --with-gravity=with-potential --with-stars=MOSAICS

Where neccessary at src/ level, tensors are within POTENTIAL_GRAVITY for now so its compilable without with-potential. 

Get the natal gas properties to pass to mosaics:
* in Anarchy-style we want weighted density? Need to check what to do here

At the end of mosaics_clevo we'll want to update gcflag depending if clusters survive or not

I/O: 
  Load star props (need TidalTensor so far)
  Also need to zero optional properties if they're not read in

------

I guess eventually we want to move tensors to their own gravity version?

Setting of the calc_tensor flag for gpart is done at start of timestep in stars_init_spart. Just want to make sure this happens before the gravity calc.

I/O: 
  Hijacked "Stars" for our parameters

  Load star props (need TidalTensor so far)
  Also need to zero optional properties if they're not read in

  Added Gravity:calculate_all_tensors to params. Presumably we want to also output all tensors to snapshots when this is set?
