./configure --with-gravity=with-potential --with-stars=MOSAICS

Need to make sure all SFing (or just all gas?) particles get tensors so they can be passed at star formation time

Get the natal gas properties to pass to mosaics:
* in Anarchy-style we want weighted density? Need to check what to do here

At the end of mosaics_clevo we'll want to update gcflag depending if clusters survive or not

I/O: 
  Load star props (need TidalTensor so far)
  Also need to zero optional properties if they're not read in

Scheduling:
  Still necessary to call mosaics from runner_do_star_formation() since occasionally SF happens but mosaics would not be called. Already scheduled after the star resort so not sure what the fix is?



Correct sound speed:

  /* Get the subgrid temperature from the tracers */
  const double subgrid_temperature = xp->tracers_data.subgrid_temp;

  /* Calculate the sound speed */
  const double sound_speed = hydro_get_physical_soundspeed(p, cosmo);

  /* Get the subgrid sound speed */
  const double sound_speed2_subgrid = sound_speed * sound_speed * subgrid_temperature / temperature; 



NOTES:
------

Setting of the calc_tensor flag for gpart is done at start of timestep in stars_init_spart. Just want to make sure this happens before the gravity calc.

I/O: 
  Hijacked "Stars" for our parameters

  Added Gravity:calculate_all_tensors to params. Do we also want to output all tensors to snapshots when this is set?
