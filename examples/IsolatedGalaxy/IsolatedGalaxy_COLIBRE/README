Running an isolated galaxy with all available COLIBRE physics. 

At the moment, this example only works on cosma. This will change as soon as the cooling tables
from Ploeckinger et al. are made public. 

For using different resolutions:

1) uncomment the relevant line in getIC.sh and run it
2) change the InitialConditions:file_name to the file that should be used
3) use a reasonable softening length for 
      - Gravity:max_physical_baryon_softening
      - HernquistPotential:epsilon
 
Suggested values for both are:

fid.hdf5        0.2
lowres8.hdf5    0.4
lowres64.hdf5   0.8
lowres512.hdf5  1.6


tested config options:
./configure --with-subgrid=COLIBRE --with-hydro=anarchy-du --with-kernel=wendland-C2 --disable-hand-vec --with-ext-potential=hernquist --enable-optimization=no --enable-debug=yes

Plotting routines:

face_on.py: uses py-sphviewer to create face on view of the galaxy and overplots the positions of HII regions
            left panel: total gas density (greyscale) and positions of HII region particles
            right panel: HII regions SPH smoothed (red)
            creates one plot for each output!

plotindivHIIregions.py: plots some properties of all HII regions in the current snapshot
            creates one plot for each output! 


plot_phasespace.py: compares the density - temperature space for the hydro variables as well as the subgrid properties
            left panel: temperature and density as used by the hydro solver
            right panel: for particles close to and below the EOS the subgrid temperature and density differs from
            the hydro properties; the rgb colors refer to the hydrogen composition as indicated
            creates one plot for each output! 

plot_small_HII.py: face on view of the galaxy for HII model testing
            left panel: young stars that create HII regions (red) and gas particles that are in HII regions (grey)
            right panel: young star particles that create HII regions color coded by the number of gas particles
            they could ionize 
            creates one plot for each output! 

plotSolution.py: argument: snapshot number
            produces an overview of different galaxy properties (mostly related to SF),
            needs to be better adapted to the COLIBRE models
