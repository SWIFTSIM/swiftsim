This is a test that produces a plot of the contribution to the cooling rate from each of the elements depending on internal energy, density and redshift based on the EAGLE tables. To do so, the function in src/cooling/EAGLE returning the cooling rate is run for multiple values of the internal energy. The resulting cooling rates are written to files and plotted with a python script (cooling_rates_plot.py). 

The test may be run by using the shell script, test_script.sh, or by running:
./testCooling -z X -d Y
python cooling_rates_plot.py

where X is the redshift at which the cooling rates are evaluated and Y is the base 10 logarithm of the hydrogen number density. Different metallicities may be specified in testCooling.yml
