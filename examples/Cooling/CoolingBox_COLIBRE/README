Run a uniform, periodic box with COLIBRE cooling and chemistry. 

The default example sets up the box with an initial temperature of 1e7 K and a density of 0.01 hydrogen atoms per cm^3, although this can be changed by editing the makeIC.py script. 

At the moment, this example only works on cosma. This will change as soon as the cooling tables from Ploeckinger et al. are made public.

Recommended config option:
./configure --with-cooling=COLIBRE --with-chemistry=COLIBRE --with-tracers=COLIBRE --with-hydro=anarchy-du --with-kernel=quintic-spline --disable-hand-vec 

Plotting routines: 

plotEnergy.py: Plots the following quantities versus time: 
               - Total internal energy in the box, taken from energy.txt (red curve). 
	       - Total internal energy in the box, summed over all particles in the snapshots (red diamonds). 
	       - Total radiated energy, taken from energy.txt (green curve). 
	       - Sum of the total internal and radiated energies, from energy.txt (blue curve). This should be constant if energy is correctly conserved. 

plotTemperature.py: Plots the temperature evolution from the simulation (red diamonds) compared to that from integrating the cooling tables directly (red curve).
