This is a test that produces a plot of the contribution to the cooling
rate from each of the elements depending on internal energy, density
and redshift based on the COLIBRE tables. To do so, the function in
src/cooling/COLIBRE returning the cooling rate is run for multiple
values of the internal energy. The resulting cooling rates for each cooling 
channel are written to files and plotted with a python script 
(plot_result_cooling.py or plot_result_heating.py).

The test may be run by:
./getCoolingTables.sh ---> TO BE DONE, on cosma the link to the tables is in the parameter file


-- for the default values (z = 0, log nH [cm-3] = -1):
./cooling_rates
python plot_result_cooling.py
python plot_result_heating.py

-- for different redshifts and densities:
redshift="0.0"
logdensity="0.00"
./cooling_rates -z $redshift -d $logdensity
python plot_result_cooling.py cooling_output_lognH$(logdensity).dat $(redshift) $(density)
python plot_result_heating.py cooling_output_lognH$(logdensity).dat $(redshift) $(density)

where redshift is the redshift at which the cooling rates are evaluated and logdensity
is the base 10 logarithm of the hydrogen number density expressed in
cgs (i.e. cm^-3). Different metallicities may be specified in
testCooling.yml
