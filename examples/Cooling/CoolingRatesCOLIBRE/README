This is a test that produces a plot of the contribution to the cooling
rate from each of the elements depending on internal energy, density
and redshift based on the COLIBRE tables. To do so, the function in
src/cooling/COLIBRE returning the cooling rate is run for multiple
values of the internal energy. The resulting cooling rates are written
to files and plotted with a python script (cooling_rates_plot.py).

The test may be run by:
./getCoolingTables.sh ---> TO BE DONE
./cooling_rates -z X -d Y
python plot_cooling_rates.py ---> TO BE DONE

where X is the redshift at which the cooling rates are evaluated and Y
is the base 10 logarithm of the hydrogen number density expressed in
cgs (i.e. cm^-3). Different metallicities may be specified in
testCooling.yml

./configure --with-subgrid=COLIBRE
