Plots the temperature evolution under isochoric and isobaric cooling.

The explicit solution integrates Eq. 5 from Gnat and Sternberg (2007) without the dN/dt term.
The implicit solution uses the bisection method. For isobaric cooling, the cooling rate is decreased
by a factor of 3/5 as:

dQ = dU + PdV = dU + 2/3 dU = 5/3 dU

The test may be run by:
./getCoolingTables.sh ---> TO BE DONE, on cosma the link to the tables is in the parameter file

redshift="0.0"
logdensity="0.00"
./cooling_evolution -z $redshift -d $logdensity
python plot_evolution.py $(density)

where redshift is the redshift at which the cooling rates are evaluated and logdensity
is the base 10 logarithm of the hydrogen number density expressed in
cgs (i.e. cm^-3). Different metallicities may be specified in
testCooling.yml
