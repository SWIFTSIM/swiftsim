This directory contains initial conditions generated for
the COLIBRE suite of simulations. The cosmology, resolution
and phases are the same as used in the original EAGLE suite. The only
difference is the file format, adapted for SWIFT.

All COLIBRE boxes have (independent of the resolution):
- the same low entropy floor (10 K at 0.1 cm-3)
- the same BH seed mass (1e5 Msol)

VELOCIraptor can be run on the output. The code is compiled
using

cmake -DVR_USE_GAS=ON -DVR_USE_STAR=ON -DV_USE_BH=ON

and run using

stf -C ../vrconfig_3dfof_subhalos_SO_hydro.cfg -i eagle_0035 -o halos_0035 -I 2

Recommended configure options:
