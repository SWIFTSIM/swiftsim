Analysis Tools
==============

Task dependencies
-----------------

At the beginning of each simulation the file ``dependency_graph.csv`` is generated and can be transformed into a ``dot`` and a ``png`` file with the script ``tools/plot_task_dependencies.py``.
It requires the ``dot`` package that is available in the library graphviz.
This script has also the possibility to generate a list of function calls for each task with the option ``--with-calls`` (this list may be incomplete).
You can convert the ``dot`` file into a ``png`` with the following command
``dot -Tpng dependency_graph.dot -o dependency_graph.png`` or directly read it with the python module ``xdot`` with ``python -m xdot dependency_graph.dot``.


Cell graph
----------

An interactive graph of the cells is available with the configuration option ``--enable-cell-graph``.
During a run, SWIFT will generate a ``cell_hierarchy_*.csv`` file per MPI rank.
The command ``tools/make_cell_hierarchy.sh cell_hierarchy_*.csv`` merges the files together and generates the file ``cell_hierarchy.html``
that contains the graph and can be read with your favorite web browser.
