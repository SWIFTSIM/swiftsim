CHIMES chemistry module
=======================

The CHIMES chemistry module tracks the time-dependent non-equilibrium evolution of up to 157 ions and molecules. These chemical abundances are used to calculate the radiative cooling and heating rates of the gas. 

The details of the CHIMES model are described in  `Richings et al. (2014a) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.440.3349R>`_ and `Richings et al. (2014b) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.2780R>`_.
