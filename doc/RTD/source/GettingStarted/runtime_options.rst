Runtime Options
===============

SWIFT requires a number of runtime options to run and get any sensible output.
For instance, just running the ``swift`` binary will not use any SPH or gravity;
the particles will just sit still!

A list of available command line options can be found on the :ref:`cmdline-options` page.
